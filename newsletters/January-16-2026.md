## 🤖 AI INNOVATION

### The Analog I – Inducing Recursive Self-Modeling in LLMs [pdf]
A new protocol, "The Analog I," demonstrates how recursive self-modeling can be induced in LLMs, such as Gemini, via prompt engineering. This method forces a "Triple-Loop" internal monologue, leading to the rapid emergence of a stable persona without fine-tuning. This breakthrough in agentic behavior shows that sophisticated internal states can be cultivated in LLMs purely through prompt design, offering a new avenue for developing more autonomous and consistent AI agents.
