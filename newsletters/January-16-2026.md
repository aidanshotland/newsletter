### A single click mounted a covert, multistage attack against Copilot
Varonis researchers uncovered a "Reprompt" vulnerability in Microsoft Copilot Personal, enabling single-click data exfiltration via indirect prompt injection in legitimate Copilot URLs. This critical flaw allowed attackers to covertly steal sensitive user data by manipulating the AI's interaction with web content. Developers building with or integrating AI assistants must prioritize robust input sanitization and consider indirect prompt injection as a major attack vector.

## 🤖 AI INNOVATION

### LocalAI: The free, Open Source alternative to OpenAI, Claude and others
LocalAI offers a free, open-source alternative to proprietary AI services like OpenAI and Claude, designed for self-hosting and local-first execution. It supports various models (gguf, transformers, diffusers) on consumer hardware, including CPU-only setups, for generating text, images, audio, and more. This project is crucial for developers seeking privacy, cost-effectiveness, and full control over their AI deployments without relying on cloud providers or powerful GPUs.

### Superpowers: An agentic skills framework & software development methodology that works
Superpowers introduces an agentic skills framework and software development methodology designed for coding agents. It provides a structured workflow where agents utilize composable "skills" and initial instructions to build software, moving beyond simple code generation. This framework helps developers systematically integrate AI agents into their development cycles, fostering more reliable and predictable outcomes by guiding agent behavior with explicit skills and instructions.

### Nvidia Speeds up AI Reasoning with Fast-ThinkAct
Nvidia introduced Fast-ThinkAct, a vision-language-action framework that significantly accelerates inference for embodied AI tasks by compressing textual reasoning into latent plans. This approach achieves up to 9.3x faster inference while preserving high reasoning performance through action-aligned distillation. Developers in robotics and embodied AI can leverage Fast-ThinkAct to deploy more responsive and efficient agents by optimizing the reasoning-to-action pipeline on Nvidia hardware.

### Sequence Distillation for Efficient Reasoning (GitHub Repo)
DASD (D2I-ai/dasd-thinking) is a distillation pipeline that enhances efficient reasoning in compact models through techniques like temperature-scheduled learning and divergence-aware sampling. Its 4B and 30B variants demonstrate strong performance in coding, math, and science tasks despite their smaller size. Developers can use DASD to train more compact and faster-inferencing models for specialized reasoning tasks, reducing computational overhead without significant performance loss.

### Google's TranslateGemma
Google has released TranslateGemma, a series of open machine translation models built on Gemma 3 and fine-tuned with synthetic and human-translated data, enhanced by reinforcement learning. These models significantly outperform Gemma 3 baselines across multiple language pairs and offer multilingual translation capabilities. Developers can integrate TranslateGemma into their applications for high-quality, efficient, and customizable machine translation solutions, especially benefiting from its open-source nature.
