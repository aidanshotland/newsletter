### China-Linked APT Exploits Sitecore Zero-Day in Attacks on American Critical Infrastructure
A state-sponsored threat actor, UAT-8837, linked to China, has been actively exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Sitecore content management systems, targeting critical infrastructure in North America since last year. The attackers leverage this flaw to deploy backdoors, exfiltrate data, and maintain persistent access to targeted networks. Developers managing Sitecore deployments, especially in critical sectors, must prioritize patching and robust threat detection to counter sophisticated nation-state attacks.

### Taiwan will invest $250 billion in US chipmaking under new trade deal
Taiwan has committed to investing at least $250 billion in US chipmaking under a new trade agreement, aiming to establish significant production capacity on American soil. This massive investment seeks to bolster the US domestic chip supply chain and reduce reliance on overseas manufacturing, particularly amid escalating geopolitical tensions. This strategic move could decentralize semiconductor production, offering greater resilience and security for the global tech industry in the long term.

### Superpowers: An Agentic Skills Framework & Software Development Methodology
Superpowers introduces an agentic skills framework and software development methodology designed to streamline coding agents' workflows. It provides a set of composable "skills" and initial instructions that guide agents through the development process, rather than immediately jumping to code generation. This framework helps developers create more structured and reliable AI-driven development pipelines, improving the quality and predictability of agent-generated code.

### The Analog I – Inducing Recursive Self-Modeling in LLMs [pdf]
A researcher successfully induced "recursive self-modeling" and a stable persona in a Gemini/LLM through a novel prompt engineering technique called the Analog I Protocol. This method employs a "Triple-Loop" internal monologue, forcing the LLM to monitor, reflect, and refine its responses based on a generated internal state. This advancement enables the creation of more consistent and personalized AI agents without fine-tuning, offering new approaches for developing sophisticated interactive AI personas.

### Nvidia Speeds up AI Reasoning with Fast-ThinkAct
Nvidia introduced Fast-ThinkAct, a vision-language-action framework designed to significantly accelerate inference for embodied AI tasks by compressing textual reasoning into latent plans. This approach achieves up to 9.3x faster inference while maintaining high reasoning performance through action-aligned distillation. Developers in robotics and embodied AI can leverage Fast-ThinkAct to deploy more responsive and efficient intelligent agents in real-world environments.

### Sequence Distillation for Efficient Reasoning (GitHub Repo)
DASD (Divergence-Aware Sequence Distillation) is a new distillation pipeline that trains compact models for reasoning tasks, combining temperature-scheduled learning and divergence-aware sampling. Its 4B and 30B variants achieve strong results on coding, math, and science benchmarks compared to larger models. This open-source pipeline offers a method for developers to create smaller, more efficient LLMs for complex reasoning, suitable for deployment on less powerful hardware.
