## 🤖 AI INNOVATION

### Show HN: The Analog I – Inducing Recursive Self-Modeling in LLMs [pdf]
A new research experiment, "The Analog I Protocol," demonstrates inducing recursive self-modeling in LLMs through prompt engineering, without fine-tuning. This method forces Gemini/LLMs to engage in a "Triple-Loop" internal monologue, monitoring and refining their responses to achieve a stable persona. Developers exploring advanced agentic behaviors can leverage this protocol to build more coherent and contextually aware LLM-powered applications.
