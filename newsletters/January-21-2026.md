## 🛡️ DEV & SECURITY

### The challenges of soft delete
Implementing soft delete (e.g., using an `archived_at` column) introduces numerous complexities beyond simple data hiding, impacting uniqueness constraints, referential integrity, and query performance. Alternatives like database triggers or moving data to separate tables can provide more robust and manageable solutions for logical deletion. Developers should carefully evaluate the architectural implications of soft delete and consider more sophisticated strategies for data lifecycle management.
