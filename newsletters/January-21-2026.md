### Google says Gemini won't have ads, as ChatGPT prepares to add them
Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis stated that Gemini will not feature advertisements for the foreseeable future, contrasting with reports that ChatGPT plans to integrate ads. While not a permanent guarantee, this indicates Google's initial strategy for monetizing its advanced AI model focuses on enterprise solutions and API access rather than consumer-facing advertising. This positioning could influence developer choice based on platform purity and potential future revenue models.
