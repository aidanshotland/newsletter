### Is the RAM shortage killing small VPS hosts?
The ongoing RAM shortage, primarily driven by massive AI inference demands, is severely impacting smaller Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers. Rising DRAM prices and reduced availability force these hosts to choose between increasing costs for customers or shrinking their profit margins, which disproportionately affects smaller businesses. Developers and companies relying on small VPS providers should anticipate potential service price hikes or consolidation in the hosting market.

### Claude Code daily benchmarks for degradation tracking
An independent tracker from MarginLab.ai is monitoring the performance degradation of Claude Code with Opus 4.5 on daily SWE (Software Engineering) tasks. This tracker uses direct CLI benchmarks to identify shifts in model efficacy over time, a common issue with rapidly evolving LLMs. Developers relying on LLMs for code generation or analysis should use such trackers to understand model reliability and adapt their workflows to potential performance fluctuations.
