### 💾 Microsoft’s new 10,000-year data storage medium: glass
Microsoft's Project Silica has demonstrated a system capable of reading and writing data into small slabs of glass for archival storage lasting millennia. This novel method utilizes femtosecond lasers to etch data into the highly stable quartz glass with densities exceeding a Gigabit per cubic millimeter. Such an ultra-durable storage solution addresses the increasing need for long-term preservation of digital information, potentially offering a cost-effective and resilient alternative to traditional magnetic or optical media.

### 🔑 DNS-Persist-01: A New Model for DNS-Based Challenge Validation
Let's Encrypt has introduced DNS-Persist-01, a new model for DNS-based challenge validation designed to enhance certificate issuance stability. This model allows DNS authorizations to be cached and reused for an extended period, simplifying automation for users with dynamic IP addresses or complex DNS setups. The change helps reduce the frequency of DNS record updates, making it easier to maintain valid certificates for services that rely on DNS challenges.
