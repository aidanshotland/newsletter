### There's a rash of scam spam coming from a real Microsoft address
A surge of scam spam is originating from legitimate Microsoft email addresses, abusing Microsoft's reputation to make phishing attempts harder to detect. This tactic bypasses standard spam filters and exploits user trust in verified senders, posing a significant security risk. Users and organizations should remain vigilant, verify suspicious links, and educate employees on advanced phishing techniques, even from seemingly legitimate sources.
