### AI is killing B2B SaaS
AI poses an existential threat to traditional B2B SaaS, causing market devaluation and customer churn as users increasingly "vibe code" custom internal tools. The shift signifies a demand for greater flexibility and tailored solutions, pushing customers away from expensive, inflexible SaaS platforms. Developers should focus on building highly customizable, AI-integrated solutions or tools that empower users to create their own.

## 🛡️ DEV & SECURITY

### Top downloaded skill in ClawHub contains malware
A top-downloaded skill in OpenClaw's ClawHub repository was found to contain malware, highlighting a critical security vulnerability within AI agent ecosystems. This incident demonstrates that popular agent skill marketplaces can become attack surfaces, where malicious code can be distributed under the guise of useful AI capabilities. Developers utilizing agentic frameworks must exercise extreme caution, verify the source of third-party skills, and implement robust security measures to protect against supply chain attacks.
