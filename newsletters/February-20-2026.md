### 🛡️ Implementing a Secure Sandbox for Local AI Agents
Cursor has detailed an "agent sandboxing" system designed to allow local coding agents to operate securely within a constrained environment. This system enables AI agents to run freely, only requesting explicit user approval when attempting to access external resources or leave the designated sandbox, such as for internet access. This approach is crucial for mitigating security risks associated with autonomous AI agents by providing a robust isolation mechanism and control over their operations.
