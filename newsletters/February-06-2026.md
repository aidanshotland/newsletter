### Orchestrate teams of Claude Code sessions
Claude Code has introduced an experimental "Agent Teams" feature, enabling multiple AI instances to collaborate on intricate tasks, coordinated by a lead agent. This approach allows agents to discuss and synthesize results among themselves, providing a higher level of autonomous problem-solving than traditional sub-agent structures. Developers can leverage Agent Teams to break down large, multifaceted projects into manageable segments, enhancing the scalability and complexity of AI-driven development.

### Building a C compiler with a team of parallel Claudes
Anthropic successfully tasked a team of 16 parallel Claude Opus 4.6 agents to autonomously build a Rust-based C compiler capable of compiling the Linux 6.9 kernel. Over two weeks and $20,000 in API costs, the agents produced a 100,000-line codebase with minimal human supervision. This demonstrates the profound potential of autonomous LLM agents for complex engineering tasks, offering a glimpse into future software development where AI can construct foundational system components.

## 🛡️ DEV & SECURITY

### The RCE that AMD won't fix
A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered in AMD processors that the company reportedly has no plans to fix. This RCE could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, posing a severe security risk to affected systems. Users and system administrators relying on AMD hardware should be aware of this unpatched vulnerability and explore mitigation strategies to protect their systems from potential exploitation.

### LinkedIn checks for 2953 browser extensions
LinkedIn is reportedly fingerprinting users by checking for the presence of 2953 specific browser extensions, raising significant privacy concerns. This extensive scanning, potentially through JavaScript execution, could reveal user browsing habits and installed software beyond LinkedIn's scope. Developers and users should be mindful of the privacy implications of websites probing browser extensions and consider tools or configurations to limit such surveillance.

### GitHub Actions Is Slowly Killing Your Engineering Team
The article argues that GitHub Actions is a flawed Continuous Integration (CI) system, despite its convenience, due to an unreliable log viewer, complex YAML syntax, and inherent security risks from its Marketplace. Many engineering teams stick with it due to deep integration with GitHub, leading to frustration and inefficiency. Developers should evaluate their CI/CD tools critically, considering alternatives or investing in robust wrapper scripts and external monitoring to mitigate GitHub Actions' shortcomings.
