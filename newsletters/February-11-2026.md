### Windows Notepad App Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2026-20841, has been discovered in the Windows Notepad application, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems. The exploit leverages specific input crafted to trigger a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption during Notepad's parsing or rendering operations. Developers and system administrators must prioritize applying the latest security patches from Microsoft to mitigate this significant risk and protect their systems from potential compromise.

### Windows' original Secure Boot certificates expire in June—here's what you need to do
Microsoft has warned that the original Secure Boot certificates for Windows will expire in June, potentially preventing older PCs from booting newer operating systems. This expiration affects systems relying on the original third-party UEFI Certificate Authority (CA) certificates for validating bootloaders. Users and IT professionals must ensure their systems have updated Secure Boot certificates installed, or be prepared to disable Secure Boot, to avoid boot failures when installing or upgrading operating systems.
